<center><b>Getting Started</b>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></center>
GTelnet is a fancy frontend to telnet, ssh, and rlogin client for <a href="http://www.gnome.org">Gnome</a>
environment with nice look and feel :-) If you have used telnet/ssh/rlogin
before, I don't think you need to read this documentation, but if you're
a newcomer from Windows or MacIntosh, you might find this documentation
helpful for you. Here are some hints and documentations that you might
need:

<a NAME="telnet"></a>The <b>telnet</b> command is used to communicate with
another host using the TELNET protocol via port 23. With telnet, you can
have a remote shell in another computer. For example, you have to update
some files at the university or your work place or you have to manage your
network remotely. Then you can do it by telnet-ing the remote computer
and do the work within its shell with vi, emacs, etc. You can also check
your e-mail from a remote host with pine.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="ssh"></a><b>SSH</b> is similar to telnet, it has the same or very
similar functions, but it is more secure. It connects to the remote host
via port 22. (<i>From SSH Manual</i>) SSH is a truly seamless and secure
replacement of old, insecure remote login programs such as rlogin or rsh.&nbsp;
According to the official SSH (Secure SHell) site, SSH is "the secure login
program that revolutionized remote management of networks hosts over the
Internet. It is a powerful, very easy-to-use program that uses strong cryptography
for protecting all transmitted confidential data, including passwords,
binary files, and administrative commands.", and SSH2 is "the sequel to
the award winning SSH1 protocol. It provides a set of radical improvements
to SSH1. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded
over the secure channel. To learn more about SSH, you can visit <a href="http://www.ssh.com">http://www.ssh.com</a>
or <a href="http://www.openssh.com">http://www.openssh.com</a>. If GTelnet
complains that ssh is not installed, please get the software from either
of those websites. Most major Linux vendors such as <a href="http://www.mandrake.com">Mandrake</a>,
<a href="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat</a>,
and <a href="http://www.suse.de">SuSE</a> have the RPM package of openssh
that can be downloaded from their FTP sites.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="rloginh"></a><b>RLogin</b> is a protocol similar to telnet that
connects via port 513, but it is rather insecure. It is recommended that
you use either telnet or SSH only.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="gtelnet"></a><a href="http://***.*****.***">GTelnet</a> is a 3-in-1
<a href="http://www.gnome.org">Gnome</a>
client frontend for all these 3 protocols with lots of bells and whistles.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="history"></a>This is the version history:</li>
