Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GNOME Telnet is a nice 3-in-1 frontend to the telnet, ssh, and rlogin client

Requirement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- autoconf >= v2.13
- automake >= v1.4
- gettext >= v0.10.34
- gtk+ >= v1.20
- gnome-core >= 1.0.55
- X Window 3.3.6
- Linux (of course) - other than Linux we can't give you a tech support

* Optional:
- SSH or OpenSSH (any version)

COMPILING & INSTALLING GTELNET (***** _IMPORTANT_ *****)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** IMPORTANT NOTICE ***
Mandrake 7.02 doesn't have the right gettext package. Please get the lattest gettext package from
ftp://ftp.flash.net/pub/linux/distributions/mandrake/7.1/Mandrake/RPMS/gettext-0.10.35-13mdk.i586.rpm
Users running Mandrake 7.1 and 7.2 and Corporate Server shouldn't have any problems

You have to log in as a root user

** Easy way to compile it: run ./compile_install (you have to be logged in as ROOT)

Hard way compile it: 
1) "./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr"
   In case it doesn't compile, use "./configure --prefix=/usr" instead
2) make
3) strip src/gnome-telnet
4) make install (you have to log in as root)
5) ./install_shared (you have to log in as root)
6) If you want to reduce the size of the binary, type: "strip /usr/bin/gnome-telnet"
   But I wouldn't recommend doing that for debug purpose. However, this v2.0 is pretty stable enough ;)

The executable can be found in "/usr/bin/gnome-telnet"
I have tested this on Redhat Linux 6.2, Mandrake Linux 7.1 with HelixGnome v1.2
If you encounter that you can't compile this on Slackware or Debian, please e-mail me to
pranalukas@gmx.de with the detail of the error messages

TODO LIST:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- This is almost the final release of Gnome-Telnet
- Check if SSH is installed or not
- I will add compatibility for OpenSSH for ssh-keygen
